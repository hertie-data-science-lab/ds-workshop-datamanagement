# SCRIPTS/Hertie Data Science Workshop Series 

The goal of this workshop series is to create a space for faculty and researchers at the Hertie School and SCRIPTS to efficiently catch up with recent developments in data science topics and tools. In the spring semester, we will focus on the basics of data manipulation and visualization in R, text as data, the gathering of information from online sources, and principles of machine learning.

*Sessions:* 

1. A gentle introduction to base R and RStudio 
2. Modern data management with R 

# Setting up RStudio Cloud 

1. After clicking the link sent in the rstudio.cloud invite email, you will be prompted to create an account. 
2. You will then be redirected to your workspace. In the sidebar, you will see a link for "SCRIPTS/Hertie Data Science Workshop Series" project. 
3. Before you work on any project, you need to first save a permanent copy of a specific project or session to save your individual changes.
